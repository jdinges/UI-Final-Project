# That Final Project

You know, for [UI Design](http://mcs.mines.edu/Courses/csci422/)? This time, it's about professors and their websites. It'll be totes magical, because Ruby on Rails.

## Goal:

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly application for professors to easily modify the layout and content of their website.  The idea is to make it intuitive for professors to quickly make a good-looking website that enhances accessibility for visitors.

## Functionality/Features

* __Choose Template__: By using this functionality, the user can quickly choose between some templates and dynamically reorganize their content. The templates will allow the professor to display their information in an attractive format without the hassle of manual CSS.
* __Modify Element__: The professor will need to be able to individually modify stylistic properties and placement of an element within predefined parameters so as to maintain consistency but enable them to have some control over look and feel.
* __Add content from other websites__: An interface to add dynamic elements (“widgets”) from other websites, such as a Twitter feed, or calendar.
Secondary Functionality
* __Upload Documents/Photos__: The professor will be able to upload content such as photos and publications related to their work so display on their webpage.
* __Add/Modify Content__: The professor will be presented with a simple interface to edit and add text content to their website, without worrying about the underlying HTML code.


## Adherence to UI principles

* __WYSIWYG editing__: Instead of raw CSS and HTML code, editing the professors website will be much closer to the way the website would look to the visitor. Elements will be drag-and-droppable to rearrange content at will.
* __Inline help__: The elements of the editor will be intuitive, and help will appear inline to the interface rather than as a separate application.
* __Responsive interface__: The interface will allow editing of content without the save/load/update interface—similar to how Google Docs works—so user and browser errors won’t accidentally lose unsaved work.
* __Design Consistency__: The templates for the website will conform to user expectations on how websites should appear (single or multi-column layout, header with navigation, footer with additional info, etc.) to avoid confusing the end users of the website.
* __Helpful feedback__: Error messages for the program will avoid technical jargon and help lead the user to solving the problem, instead of confusing them further.  In addition, the error messages will be in places the user will expect to see them.
